# findListingAgent

Little data science project to find the best agent to list a house for sale based on their ability
to get an above market price for it in a reasonable amount of time

Includes a [notebook to scrape](./blob/main/scraper.ipynb) a popular real-estate website (rhymes with *pillow*) as well as some basic [analysis](./blob/main/analyze.ipynb).
