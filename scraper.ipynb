    "# Finding a Realtor using DATA\n",
    "The objective is to use data from recent house sales to pick a realtor to list a house.\n",
    "A good listing agent will get you a good price for your house in a reasonable amount of time. It matters less what kind of car they drive, what their lawn signs look like, or how they dress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way of finding a realtor is through referrals from friends and neighbors. Here instead we'll use *data* to narrow down the list of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook *scrapes* data from recently sold listings on zillow to grab the basic parameters of the houses along with information about the listing agent. While zillow does have a published API, it doesn't expose enough information to actually do this work. So we have to scrape. Internally zillow uses GraphQL but this modern API is not exposed for use by other applications."

    "The basic approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a search run by the user. All the parameters of the search will end up becoming URL parameters which makes it easy to then `GET` the search results page.\n",
    "1. Grab the basic information for each listing on that page\n",
    "1. Loop over the number of pages in the search results (could anywhere from 1 to hundreds, you might want to limit the number of listings you're after)\n",
    "1. For each search result, perform additional GraphQL queries to get data that is not presented on the page by default. This mimics what happens when the user clicks on a zillow detail page section to expand it.\n",
    "1. Make sure the scraping looks as much as possible like human behavior to avoid getting blocked\n",
